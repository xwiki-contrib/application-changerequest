  <!-- The complexity metrics are not respected on EditChangeRequestResourceHandler for now. Note that in the future
  this handler should be mostly an inheritance of an EditResourceHandler that will belocated in xwiki-platform and most
  of the code put in the current class will be put in commons for the various actions. For now we keep it like that
  since it avoids extending an old XWikiAction. -->
