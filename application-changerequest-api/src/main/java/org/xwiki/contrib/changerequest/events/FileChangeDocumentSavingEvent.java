/**
 * This event is triggered when a {@link org.xwiki.contrib.changerequest.FileChange} is about to be saved.
 * The corresponding end event is {@link FileChangeDocumentSavedEvent}.
 * This event should be listened to if the document subject to changes should be modified before being stored in the
 * change request. It can also allow to perform modification in the filechange itself.
 * Also note that this event is cancelable: it means it's possible to call {@link #cancel()} in which case the
 * {@link org.xwiki.contrib.changerequest.storage.FileChangeStorageManager} should throw an exception before saving it.
 *
 * The event also send the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>source: the {@link org.xwiki.contrib.changerequest.FileChange} about to be saved</li>
 *     <li>data: the XWikiDocument where the filechange will be saved. (or {@code null} in case of a remote event).
 *              Note that this document does not yet contain the data from the filechange when this event is
 *              triggered.</li>
