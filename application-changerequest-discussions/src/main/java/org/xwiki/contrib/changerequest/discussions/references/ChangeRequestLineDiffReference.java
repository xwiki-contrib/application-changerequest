/**
 * Represents a reference attached to a particular line of a file diff.

 * <ul>
 *     <li>the identifier of the change request where the diff is computed</li>
 *     <li>the identifier of the file change used for computing the diff</li>
 *     <li>the part of the diff where to find the line (e.g. content of the document, properties, xobjects, etc)</li>
 *     <li>the actual line number of the given document part</li>
 *     <li>the type of change (addition, deletion or context) since the same line number could refer to different lines
 *     in a diff</li>
